## 📈 Initial Observations
- Budget column is stored as text (`object`), likely due to commas or formatting → will need cleaning.  
- Fiscal Years range from [min] to [max].  
- Departments: [number unique].  
- Programs: [number unique].  

---

## 📌 Next Steps
- Clean and convert `Budget` column to numeric.  
- Decide on primary keys for deduplication (likely Fiscal Year + Department + Program + Fund).  
- Prepare schema for PostgreSQL ingestion.
